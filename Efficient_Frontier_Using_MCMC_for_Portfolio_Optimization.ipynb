        "In the finance world, risk is **probability of losing 'X' amount of investment** or **return volatility of an investment over a given time period**. Typically when people in finance talk about risk it is the second defintion, and we will also hence forth be using the second definition too. This **return volatility** is usally denoted by **σ** (sigma) AKA standard deviation, a statistical figure that is calculated as the $ \\sqrt{\\sigma^2} $\n",
        "or **positive** sqaure root of variance.\n",
        "- You could think it as how spread/variable return of a investment/s are\n",

        "\n",
        "## What is Return\n",
        "Return (AKA Profit/Capital Gain) is usally presented as a percentage relative to the orignal investment. However, when discussing forecasting and portfolio mangement we use **Expected Returns** $ E(R) $, a value estimate of a average outcome, calculated based on **potential** profit or losses from an investment over a future period which is usually presented as a numerical value but can also be a percentage.\n",
